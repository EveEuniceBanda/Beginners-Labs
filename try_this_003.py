# Default usage of the print() is as follows:
#print (*objects, sep=' ', enf='\n', file=sys.stdout, flush=False)
#
print("Hello,", end='') # Here we pass an argument to the end with no \n
print('world!')          # This line has an implied \n
print('Have a good day!')# You can also use single quotes for a string
